## 🔧 Key Features
- Real-time parking slot detection using IR/ultrasonic sensors  
- Automated gate control via PLC logic  
- Live slot availability display on LED panels  
- IoT integration (ESP8266) for mobile/web monitoring  
- Mobile app interface for users (slot status, reservations)

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools
- PLC (e.g., Siemens/Allen-Bradley)  
- IoT Modules (ESP8266/NodeMCU)  
- Sensors (IR, Ultrasonic)  
- Ladder Logic Programming  
- IoT Platforms (Blynk, ThingSpeak, Firebase)  
- Mobile App (Android Studio/Flutter)
